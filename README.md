# imcdf-lib-java
Java library code to read and write INTERMAGNET CDF (IMCDF) data files

Brief documentation on using the code is in the header of ImagCDFFactory.java

This code depends on NASA's CDF library: http://cdf.gsfc.nasa.gov/html/sw_and_docs.html
It also depends on the pure Java CDF library: https://github.com/INTERMAGNET/cdfj
